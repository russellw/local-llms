passed: False   stopped: error   steps: 8/26   edits: 1   test runs: 2   failing at end: 13/16

## step 1

I'll help you fix the router project. First, let's explore what files are available to understand the project structure.

    -> list_files({})

       SPEC.md (38 lines)
       src/__init__.py (0 lines)
       src/pattern.py (32 lines)
       src/router.py (46 lines)

## step 2

Now let's read the key files to understand what we're working with. Let's start with the router.py file since that's what needs to be fixed:

    -> read_file({"path": "src/router.py"})

       """A URL router. See SPEC.md for the matching rules."""
       
       from .pattern import STATIC, PARAM, WILD, compile_pattern, split_path
       
       
       class Route:
           def __init__(self, pattern, handler, order):
               self.pattern = pattern
               self.segments = compile_pattern(pattern)
               self.handler = handler
               self.order = order
       
       
       class Router:
           def __init__(self):
               self.routes = []
       
           def add(self, pattern, handler):
               self.routes.append(Route(pattern, handler, len(self.routes)))
       
           def match(self, path):
               """Return (handler, params) for the best matching route, or None."""
               for route in self.routes:
                   params = _try(route, split_path(path))
                   if params is not None:
                       return route.handler, params
               return None
       
       
       def _t... (truncated)

## step 3

Now let's read the pattern.py file to understand the pattern matching components:

    -> read_file({"path": "src/pattern.py"})

       """Compiling a pattern string into segments. See SPEC.md."""
       
       STATIC = "static"
       PARAM = "param"
       WILD = "wild"
       
       
       class Segment:
           def __init__(self, kind, text):
               self.kind = kind
               self.text = text
       
           def __repr__(self):
               return f"Segment({self.kind}, {self.text!r})"
       
       
       def split_path(path):
           """Split a request path into its segments."""
           return path.strip("/").split("/")
       
       
       def compile_pattern(pattern):
           """Turn a pattern string into a list of Segments."""
           out = []
           for raw in split_path(pattern):
               if raw.startswith(":"):
                   out.append(Segment(PARAM, raw))
               elif raw.startswith("*"):
                   out.append(Segment(WILD, raw))
               else:
                   out.append(Segment(STATIC, raw))
           return out

## step 4

Now let's read the SPEC.md to understand the requirements:

    -> read_file({"path": "SPEC.md"})

       # Router
       
       Maps a request path to a registered route and captures its parameters.
       
       ## Patterns
       
       A pattern is a `/`-separated list of segments. A segment is one of:
       
       - **static** -- matches itself exactly: `users`
       - **parameter** -- `:name`, matches exactly one segment and captures it under
         `name`
       - **wildcard** -- `*name`, matches **all remaining segments** and captures them
         joined with `/`. Only legal as the last segment. It may match zero segments,
         capturing `""`.
       
       ## Precedence
       
       This is the part that is easy to get wrong.
       
       **Registration order does not decide anything.** When several patterns match a
       path, the winner is chosen by comparing segments left to right. At the first
       segment where the candidates differ, the more specific one wins:
       
           static  >  parameter  >  wildcard
       
       So... (truncated)

## step 5

Now let's run the tests to see what's failing:

    -> run_tests({})

       6/16 tests passed
       FAIL: static_beats_param_registered_later: handler for /users/me was 'param', expected 'static'
       FAIL: param_still_matches_other_paths: match for /users/42 was ('param', {':id': '42'}), expected ('param', {'id': '42'})
       FAIL: param_beats_wildcard: handler for /users/42 was 'wild', expected 'param'
       FAIL: specificity_is_decided_at_the_first_differing_segment: handler for /x/y/c was 'params', expected 'static_first'
       FAIL: param_names_drop_the_marker: captured params was {':id': '7'}, expected {'id': '7'}
       FAIL: two_params: captured params was {':org': 'acme', ':name': 'tools'}, expected {'org': 'acme', 'name': 'tools'}
       FAIL: wildcard_captures_all_remaining_segments: captured wildcard was {'*path': 'a'}, expected {'path': 'a/b/c.txt'}
       FAIL: wildcard_captures_one_segment: capture... (truncated)

## step 6

Looking at the test failures, I can see several issues with the current implementation:

1. The specificity matching logic is not implemented correctly
2. Parameter names are not being processed correctly (they still have the `:` prefix)
3. Wildcard matching logic is flawed
4. The trailing slash handling is not correct

Let me analyze the problems more carefully and fix them step by step.

First, let me understand what the current `_try` function is doing wrong:

    -> replace_in_file({"path": "src/router.py", "old": "\"\"\"A URL router. See SPEC.md for the matching rules.\"\"\"\n\nfrom .pattern import STATIC, PARAM, WILD, compile_pattern, split_path\n\n\nclass Route:\n    def __init__(self, pattern, handler, order):\n        self.pattern = pattern\n        self.segments = compile_pattern(pattern)\n        self.handler = handle... (1356 chars)", "new": "\"\"\"A URL router. See SPEC.md for the matching rules.\"\"\"\n\nfrom .pattern import STATIC, PARAM, WILD, compile_pattern, split_path\n\n\nclass Route:\n    def __init__(self, pattern, handler, order):\n        self.pattern = pattern\n        self.segments = compile_pattern(pattern)\n        self.handler = handle... (2858 chars)"})

       replaced 1 occurrence in src/router.py

## step 7

Let me run the tests again to see how I'm doing:

    -> run_tests({})
