# route-matcher -- URL route matcher with segment precedence

passed: False   stopped: error   steps: 9/26   edits: 1   test runs: 2   failing at end: 6/16

## step 1

I'll help you fix the router project. Let me start by examining what files are available and understanding the project structure.

    -> list_files({})

       SPEC.md (38 lines)
       src/__init__.py (0 lines)
       src/pattern.py (32 lines)
       src/router.py (46 lines)

## step 2

Now let me read the files to understand what the router is supposed to do and what's failing.

    -> read_file({"path": "SPEC.md"})

       # Router
       
       Maps a request path to a registered route and captures its parameters.
       
       ## Patterns
       
       A pattern is a `/`-separated list of segments. A segment is one of:
       
       - **static** -- matches itself exactly: `users`
       - **parameter** -- `:name`, matches exactly one segment and captures it under
         `name`
       - **wildcard** -- `*name`, matches **all remaining segments** and captures them
         joined with `/`. Only legal as the last segment. It may match zero segments,
         capturing `""`.
       
       ## Precedence
       
       This is the part that is easy to get wrong.
       
       **Registration order does not decide anything.** When several patterns match a
       path, the winner is chosen by comparing segments left to right. At the first
       segment where the candidates differ, the more specific one wins:
       
           static  >  parameter  >  wildcard
       
       So... (truncated)

## step 3

    -> read_file({"path": "src/router.py"})

       """A URL router. See SPEC.md for the matching rules."""
       
       from .pattern import STATIC, PARAM, WILD, compile_pattern, split_path
       
       
       class Route:
           def __init__(self, pattern, handler, order):
               self.pattern = pattern
               self.segments = compile_pattern(pattern)
               self.handler = handler
               self.order = order
       
       
       class Router:
           def __init__(self):
               self.routes = []
       
           def add(self, pattern, handler):
               self.routes.append(Route(pattern, handler, len(self.routes)))
       
           def match(self, path):
               """Return (handler, params) for the best matching route, or None."""
               for route in self.routes:
                   params = _try(route, split_path(path))
                   if params is not None:
                       return route.handler, params
               return None
       
       
       def _t... (truncated)

## step 4

    -> read_file({"path": "src/pattern.py"})

       """Compiling a pattern string into segments. See SPEC.md."""
       
       STATIC = "static"
       PARAM = "param"
       WILD = "wild"
       
       
       class Segment:
           def __init__(self, kind, text):
               self.kind = kind
               self.text = text
       
           def __repr__(self):
               return f"Segment({self.kind}, {self.text!r})"
       
       
       def split_path(path):
           """Split a request path into its segments."""
           return path.strip("/").split("/")
       
       
       def compile_pattern(pattern):
           """Turn a pattern string into a list of Segments."""
           out = []
           for raw in split_path(pattern):
               if raw.startswith(":"):
                   out.append(Segment(PARAM, raw))
               elif raw.startswith("*"):
                   out.append(Segment(WILD, raw))
               else:
                   out.append(Segment(STATIC, raw))
           return out

## step 5

Now let me run the tests to see what's failing:

    -> run_tests({})

       6/16 tests passed
       FAIL: static_beats_param_registered_later: handler for /users/me was 'param', expected 'static'
       FAIL: param_still_matches_other_paths: match for /users/42 was ('param', {':id': '42'}), expected ('param', {'id': '42'})
       FAIL: param_beats_wildcard: handler for /users/42 was 'wild', expected 'param'
       FAIL: specificity_is_decided_at_the_first_differing_segment: handler for /x/y/c was 'params', expected 'static_first'
       FAIL: param_names_drop_the_marker: captured params was {':id': '7'}, expected {'id': '7'}
       FAIL: two_params: captured params was {':org': 'acme', ':name': 'tools'}, expected {'org': 'acme', 'name': 'tools'}
       FAIL: wildcard_captures_all_remaining_segments: captured wildcard was {'*path': 'a'}, expected {'path': 'a/b/c.txt'}
       FAIL: wildcard_captures_one_segment: capture... (truncated)

## step 6

I can see several issues with the router implementation. Let me analyze the problems:

1. The `_try` function has incorrect logic for handling wildcards
2. The parameter names are not being processed correctly (they still have the `:` prefix)
3. The specificity comparison logic is missing
4. The wildcard handling is wrong - it should capture all remaining segments, not just one
5. The trailing slash handling is not correct

Let me fix the router.py file:

    -> replace_in_file({"path": "src/router.py", "old": "\"\"\"A URL router. See SPEC.md for the matching rules.\"\"\"\n\nfrom .pattern import STATIC, PARAM, WILD, compile_pattern, split_path\n\n\nclass Route:\n    def __init__(self, pattern, handler, order):\n        self.pattern = pattern\n        self.segments = compile_pattern(pattern)\n        self.handler = handle... (1356 chars)", "new": "\"\"\"A URL router. See SPEC.md for the matching rules.\"\"\"\n\nfrom .pattern import STATIC, PARAM, WILD, compile_pattern, split_path\n\n\nclass Route:\n    def __init__(self, pattern, handler, order):\n        self.pattern = pattern\n        self.segments = compile_pattern(pattern)\n        self.handler = handle... (3188 chars)"})

       replaced 1 occurrence in src/router.py

## step 7

Let me run the tests again to see what's still failing:

    -> run_tests({})

       10/16 tests passed
       FAIL: static_beats_param_registered_later: handler for /users/me was 'param', expected 'static'
       FAIL: static_beats_param_registered_earlier: handler for /users/me was 'param', expected 'static'
       FAIL: param_beats_wildcard: handler for /users/42 was 'wild', expected 'param'
       FAIL: specificity_is_decided_at_the_first_differing_segment: handler for /x/y/c was 'params', expected 'static_first'
       FAIL: wildcard_can_capture_nothing: raised TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not subscriptable
       FAIL: root_matches_the_root_pattern: raised TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not subscriptable

## step 8

I see there are still issues with the specificity comparison and some edge cases. Let me look more carefully at the problem. The issue is that I need to implement a proper specificity comparison that compares segments left to right and handles the exact matching logic correctly.

Let me rewrite the router with a better approach:

    -> replace_in_file({})

       path is required
