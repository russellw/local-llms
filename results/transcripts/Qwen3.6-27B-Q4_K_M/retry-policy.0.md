# retry-policy -- Retry policy spanning a classifier and a backoff calculator

passed: True   stopped: finish   steps: 9/28   edits: 2   test runs: 3   failing at end: 0/13

## step 1

Let me start by understanding the project structure and then run the tests to see what's failing.

    -> list_files({})

       SPEC.md (51 lines)
       src/__init__.py (0 lines)
       src/classify.py (19 lines)
       src/policy.py (31 lines)

## step 2

Let me read the files to understand the project structure.

    -> read_file({"path": "SPEC.md"})

       # Retry policy
       
       Two pieces that have to agree: `classify` decides what kind of failure
       happened, and `RetryPolicy` decides whether and when to try again. A correct
       delay calculation on a misclassified error is still the wrong answer, so both
       sides matter.
       
       ## Classification
       
       `classify(status, message="")` returns one of `RETRYABLE`, `THROTTLED`,
       `FATAL`.
       
       - `408`, `500`, `502`, `503`, `504` -- **RETRYABLE**
       - `429` -- **THROTTLED**. It is not fatal, and it is not an ordinary retryable
         error either; it has its own delay rule below.
       - Any other status at or above 400 -- **FATAL**
       - Any status below 400 -- **FATAL** (it is not a failure, so there is nothing
         to retry)
       - `status=None` means the request never got a reply. The message decides: if it
         mentions `timeout` or `reset`, **RETRYABL... (truncated)

    -> read_file({"path": "src/policy.py"})

       """Deciding whether and when to try again. See SPEC.md."""
       
       from .classify import classify, RETRYABLE, THROTTLED, FATAL
       
       
       class RetryPolicy:
           def __init__(self, base_delay, max_delay, max_attempts, max_elapsed, rng):
               self.base_delay = base_delay
               self.max_delay = max_delay
               self.max_attempts = max_attempts
               self.max_elapsed = max_elapsed
               self.rng = rng
       
           def next_delay(self, attempt, status, retry_after=None, elapsed=0.0, message=""):
               """Seconds to wait before the next try, or None if there must not be one."""
               kind = classify(status, message)
               if kind == FATAL:
                   return None
               if attempt > self.max_attempts:
                   return None
       
               if kind == THROTTLED and retry_after is not None:
                   delay =... (truncated)

## step 3

Let me read the classify.py file as well.

    -> read_file({"path": "src/classify.py"})

       """Deciding what kind of failure happened. See SPEC.md."""
       
       RETRYABLE = "retryable"
       THROTTLED = "throttled"
       FATAL = "fatal"
       
       _RETRYABLE_STATUSES = {408, 500, 502, 503, 504}
       
       
       def classify(status, message=""):
           """Classify a failed request."""
           if status is None:
               text = (message or "")
               if "timeout" in text or "reset" in text:
                   return RETRYABLE
               return FATAL
           if status in _RETRYABLE_STATUSES:
               return RETRYABLE
           return FATAL

## step 4

Now let me run the tests to see what's failing.

    -> run_tests({})

       7/13 tests passed
       FAIL: classification_of_an_upper_case_message: classification of an upper-case timeout was 'fatal', expected 'retryable'
       FAIL: delay_on_attempt_0: delay on attempt 0 was 4.0, expected 2.0
       FAIL: delay_on_attempts_1_and_2: delay on attempt 1 was 8.0, expected 4.0
       FAIL: delay_with_a_quarter_jitter: delay on attempt 1 was 4.0, expected 2.0
       FAIL: delay_on_attempts_1_and_2_of_3: delay on the last of 3 attempts was 4.0, expected None
       FAIL: delay_when_max_attempts_is_1: delay when only one try is permitted was 1.0, expected None

## step 5

Let me run the tests first to see the current state, then I'll analyze and fix the issues.

    -> run_tests({})

       7/13 tests passed
       FAIL: classification_of_an_upper_case_message: classification of an upper-case timeout was 'fatal', expected 'retryable'
       FAIL: delay_on_attempt_0: delay on attempt 0 was 4.0, expected 2.0
       FAIL: delay_on_attempts_1_and_2: delay on attempt 1 was 8.0, expected 4.0
       FAIL: delay_with_a_quarter_jitter: delay on attempt 1 was 4.0, expected 2.0
       FAIL: delay_on_attempts_1_and_2_of_3: delay on the last of 3 attempts was 4.0, expected None
       FAIL: delay_when_max_attempts_is_1: delay when only one try is permitted was 1.0, expected None

## step 6

I can see several issues. Let me fix them one by one.

**Issue 1: `classify.py`** - 429 should return THROTTLED, and the timeout/reset check needs to be case-insensitive.

    -> replace_in_file({"path": "src/classify.py", "old": "def classify(status, message=\"\"):\n    \"\"\"Classify a failed request.\"\"\"\n    if status is None:\n        text = (message or \"\")\n        if \"timeout\" in text or \"reset\" in text:\n            return RETRYABLE\n        return FATAL\n    if status in _RETRYABLE_STATUSES:\n        return RETRYABLE\n    return FA... (303 chars)", "new": "def classify(status, message=\"\"):\n    \"\"\"Classify a failed request.\"\"\"\n    if status is None:\n        text = (message or \"\").lower()\n        if \"timeout\" in text or \"reset\" in text:\n            return RETRYABLE\n        return FATAL\n    if status == 429:\n        return THROTTLED\n    if status in _RET... (358 chars)"})

       replaced 1 occurrence in src/classify.py

## step 7

**Issue 2: `policy.py`** - Multiple issues with delay calculation, attempt limit, and elapsed check.

    -> replace_in_file({"path": "src/policy.py", "old": "    def next_delay(self, attempt, status, retry_after=None, elapsed=0.0, message=\"\"):\n        \"\"\"Seconds to wait before the next try, or None if there must not be one.\"\"\"\n        kind = classify(status, message)\n        if kind == FATAL:\n            return None\n        if attempt > self.max_attempts... (670 chars)", "new": "    def next_delay(self, attempt, status, retry_after=None, elapsed=0.0, message=\"\"):\n        \"\"\"Seconds to wait before the next try, or None if there must not be one.\"\"\"\n        kind = classify(status, message)\n        if kind == FATAL:\n            return None\n        if attempt >= self.max_attempt... (702 chars)"})

       replaced 1 occurrence in src/policy.py

## step 8

Now let me run the tests to see if all issues are fixed.

    -> run_tests({})

       13/13 tests passed
       all tests passed

## step 9

All 13 tests pass now. The fixes were:

1. **`classify.py`**: Added handling for status 429 (THROTTLED) and made the timeout/reset message check case-insensitive by lowercasing the text.

2. **`policy.py`**: 
   - Fixed the exponential backoff formula from `2 ** (attempt + 1)` to `2 ** attempt`
   - Cap the ceiling at `max_delay` **before** applying jitter (not after)
   - Fixed the attempt limit check from `attempt > max_attempts` to `attempt >= max_attempts - 1`
   - Added `min(retry_after, max_delay)` cap for THROTTLED delays
   - Fixed the elapsed budget check from `elapsed > max_elapsed` to `elapsed + delay > max_elapsed`

    -> finish({"summary": "Fixed classify.py to handle 429 as THROTTLED and made timeout/reset matching case-insensitive. Fixed policy.py: corrected backoff exponent (attempt not attempt+1), cap ceiling before jitter, fixed attempt limit check (>= max_attempts-1), cap THROTTLED at max_delay, and check elapsed+delay against ma... (310 chars)"})

       ended
